# Theming

To help style components consistently, and to make it easy to change the look
and feel of multiple components, we can use the `ThemeProvider` component from
`styled-components`. The `ThemeProvider` component gives all `styled-components`
access to a special `theme` prop, which can be used for custom styles.

```js
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${props => props.theme.primary};
  color: ${props => props.theme.fontColor};
  padding: 1rem;
  font-size: 1em;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
`;

const theme = {
  primary: "dodgerblue",
  fontColor: "white",
};

function App() {
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button>I can use the theme!</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>;
}
```

## Exercise

This setup also makes it easy to switch between themes by using _state_! In the
example code, we have two basic themes set up &mdash; a `lightTheme` and a
`darkTheme`. See if you can change the theme by clicking on a button.
